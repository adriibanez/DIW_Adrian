                    You don't have
                    to be perfect, you don't have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don't have to change
                    everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.

                    <p>Fat. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of

                    Prepare more of your own meals. Cooking more meals at home can help you
                    take
                    charge of what you're eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food. You'll eat
                    fewer
                    calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and unhealthy fats of packaged and
                    takeout
                    foods that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of
                    depression, stress, and anxiety.

                <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving
                    yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
                    health, and boosting your mood.
                </p>

                <p>Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting
                    nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you
                    a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that
                    while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s
                    your overall dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to
                    replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to
                    the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.
